                    <p *ngIf="who">I am a freshly minted web developer, currently looking to work in a front-end development position. I have a background in e-commerce, consisting of building CMS components, designing and developing corporate webpages, and maintaining various internal tools. I am especially passionate about UX and UI design. </p>
                    <h5 id="how" (click)="openPar('how');">how i got here</h5>
                    <p *ngIf="how">Before receiving Seneca College’s Computer Programming diploma, I completed a B.A. in Sociology at the University of Guelph. As an undergrad, I developed an interest in how people interact with technology, and took courses on computer systems and user interface design. Entering a new academic field with the goal of becoming a web developer, I had the opportunity to intern as a full-stack developer for Softchoice. During my co-op, I built product pages for multi-million dollar clients, maintained internal tools and sections of the Softchoice website, and built reuseable components for a new headless CMS. </p>
                    <h5 id="interests" (click)="openPar('interests');">my interests</h5>
                    <p *ngIf="interests">Working in a creative and technical field, I draw a lot of inspiration from science fiction. William Gibson’s Neuromancer and Ursula Leguin’s The Left Hand of Darkness are long time favourites in terms of novels, while Black Mirror and Futurama are my favourite TV series. Exercise and being outdoors with loved ones are central to my wellbeing - a precept I live out through activities such as sailing, skiing, and camping. </p>
