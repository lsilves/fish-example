I have a background in full-stack development, consisting of building CMS components, designing and developing corporate webpages, and maintaining various internal tools. I am especially passionate about UX and UI design. </p>

As an undergrad, I developed an interest in how people interact with technology, and took courses on computer systems and user interface design. Entering a new academic field with the goal of becoming a web developer, I had the opportunity to intern as a full-stack developer for Softchoice. During my co-op, I built product pages for multi-million dollar clients, maintained internal tools and sections of the Softchoice website, and built reuseable components for a new headless CMS. </p>

I have previously co-published a paper on the portrayal of mental health in film; likewise, I am currently building an application that facilitates the writing of psychiatric assessments. Central to my own conception of wellbeing are exercise and being outdoors with loved ones - precepts I live out through activities such as sailing, skiing, and camping. </p>
